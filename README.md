# Desaurus v2
Desaurus is a Reddit bot designed to simplify text. Summon it like so:

    /u/desaurus_bot [text to simplify]

For example:

    /u/desaurus_bot She proffered a grandiose idea.



Most of this stuff is legacy code from the original desaurus, which I wrote in early 2017. And didn't document. At all.
So, even I don't understand most of it. :(
